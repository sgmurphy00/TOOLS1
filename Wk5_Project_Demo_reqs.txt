You are supposed to present your project in form of a slide deck which should roughly be around 5 minutes. At least one member, preferably both, should present. The presentation should be brief and should not take much time to prepare. I would expect you to include the following about your project:

1. Problem description and importance

Can we identify adversarial data from a GAN attack affecting a image classifier. Is there a statistically detectable effect of adversarially generated data vs true data. Can we identify which images are adversarial data that are the by product of the GAN Attack. 

2. Initial insights gathered (This could be the EDA you have done yet)
- Develop CNN for Baseline
- Develop simple GAN Attack to degrade baseline
- Show diff of results between the two as intial EDA

- Loss function: Parse Categorical Cross Entropy <- model.

3. Dataset and how the data was acquired.
- https://www.kaggle.com/code/agajorte/sat-6-aerial-images-classification

4. Initial hypothesis (What do you think the final results will help you achieve)

-  Can we identify which images are adversarial data that are the by product of the GAN Attack.

5. Modeling and/or analysis techniques you plan to use.
- Bayesian models?
- Reforcement Learning? (Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVMs, K-Means, Clusterings)
- Generic Algorithms?


6. Problems that you're facing


7. Project timeline (optional)
- First step, build CNN classifier, implement on collab, document environment requirements
- Second Step, implement GAN Attack, leveraging home-brew solution or ART toolbox. Leverage a Fast Gradient Attack. Take the fundamental math around these attacks and implement a solution.
- Step 3: Perform EDA highlighting model perform drop
- Step 4: Perform literature on methods to identify GAN-Attacks
- Step 5: Perform trade-study of analysis techiques betweek Bayesian or Reforement Learning



Please make sure to include the above-mentioned requirements. This shouldn't take long and you should keep your deck simple. Primarily, emphasize the need or impact of your project.
