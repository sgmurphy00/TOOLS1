You are supposed to present your project in form of a slide deck which should roughly be around 5 minutes. At least one member, preferably both, should present. The presentation should be brief and should not take much time to prepare. I would expect you to include the following about your project:

1. Problem description and importance

2. Initial insights gathered (This could be the EDA you have done yet)

3. Dataset and how the data was acquired.

4. Initial hypothesis (What do you think the final results will help you achieve)

5. Modeling and/or analysis techniques you plan to use.

6. Problems that you're facing

7. Project timeline (optional)

Please make sure to include the above-mentioned requirements. This shouldn't take long and you should keep your deck simple. Primarily, emphasize the need or impact of your project.
